                <h1>Myth: Accessibility is 'blind people'</h1>

            <p>Accessibility is often viewed as making your site work on screen readers. <br>
            In reality, web accessibility is a subset of User Experience (UX) focused on making your <br>
            websites usable by the widest range of people possible, including those who have disabilities.
            </p>  
            <br>
            
            <h2>Four categories of accessibility</h2>
            <p>Accessibility can be broken down into four key categories:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Visual
                    <p>This can be non-sighted users, users with low-vision, users with obstructed vision, <br>
                        or even simply your aging parents.</p>

                    <ul> 
                        <li>Associated conditions</li>
                        <li>Myopia</li>
                        <li>Colour blindness</li>
                        <li>Glaucoma</li>
                        <li>Albinism</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


                <li>Auditory
                    <p>The web is a visual medium, but captions and fallbacks for sound-necessary media <br>
                        need to be considered for hearing impaired  users.</p>

                    <ul> 
                        <li>Associated conditions</li>
                        <li>Presbycusis</li>
                        <li>Acoustic trauma</li>
                        <li>Auditory processing disorder</li>
                        <li>Otosclerosis</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>


                <li>Motor
                     <p>People with motor impairments typically use a wide range of assistive technology from <br>
                    specialized keyboards, to eye trackers, to using single buttons (a device known as a “switch”) <br>
                    to navigate their computers.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Associated conditions</li>
                        <li>RSI</li>
                        <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
                        <li>Parkinson’s</li>
                        <li>Muscular dystrophy</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


            <li>Cognitive
                   <p>Relates to the ease processing of information.</p>

                   <ul>
                       <li>Associated conditions</li>
                       <li>Down’s syndrome</li>
                       <li>Autism</li>
                       <li>Global developmental delay</li>
                       <li>Dyslexia</li>
                   </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

            <h3>Temporary disabilities</h3>
            
            
            <p>While each of these disabilities is usually permanent, there are often situations in which even fully-abled <br>
            people are “temporarily disabled”. For instance, an arm or wrist injury may temporarily prevent you from <br>
            being able to use a mouse.</p>
        
            <br>
            
            <p>Robin Christopherson (an accessibility expert who is blind) once spoke about how people that are driving <br>
            but use hands-free sets or have their phone connected to the car radio are temporarily disabled, as they <br>
            use the phone differently to how they normally would. Of course, no one should browse websites while they <br>
            are driving but it is important to understand different situations like that, where the user may not have <br>
            special software installed that a disabled user might.</p>
